# This last print line seems to be a misunderstanding of decorators usage.
# If you want to demonstrate calling the decorated function directly, it should be like this:
say_hello()  # This will automatically include the delay because of the @delay_decorator
say_bye()    # Same as above

# If you're trying to use the decorator directly in a single call, itâ€™s not done with print, but like this:
delay_decorator(say_greeting)()
